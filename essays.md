It is often heated debate, the opposing arguments can perhaps be summarized as follows. 
Proponents of X claim that Y
This argument is often used to justify X
Moreover, the argument goes, X
However, opponents of the X respond that Y
They point out that, if X 
It must be said that X
What is more, if X, Y would then be Z and thus would help more 
To conclude, it appears to me that opponents of X have the more robust argument, with their concerns over Y
We all recognize X, but surely Y
For one thing, we should remember that X
This would in turn make X
Finally, we should remember that X
Admittedly, I agree with those who say X
It erodes individual freedom
It is admirable that governments seek to reduce X, and are prepared to use Y to achieve this
However, the arguments on both sides of this particular discussion (about X) are by no means straightforward, as we shall see now
On the one hand, those who favour X, say that only by doing Y
Indeed, there are many examples of X
A further argument is that X, rather like Y
Such arguments are persuasive and often used by media supporters of X
By contrast, other people point to X
After all, they say, we would not allow X
Another counter-argument is X
X that actually stem from these methods 
It appears to be true that X, rather than Y
The evident lack of effectiveness of such methods 
We should urge X, which would have a higher benefit in terms of Y
I will outline two such risks, and also two possible countermeasures we could take. 
X, for example, is attributable to this cause each year
A second problem must be rather X
X may well be connected to this phenomenon 
Turning to possible solutions, it would be helpful to see a join initiative between authorities and X producers to raise public awareness of these risks
Such a program could take many forms, ranging from X to Y, and could be aimed at both the Z and the A, which would make it very cost-effective 
Overall, the dangers of this situation are both physical and social. 
Potential remedies may involve better X
To say that X is 'unnecessary' is to neglect
Finally, and perhaps most importantly
However, it would be unwise for people to completely ignore X, for reasons which I will explain here
Overall, the factors behind X tend to be commercial or connected to Y
Few could doubt, for example, that X
The resulting consequences of X
The roots of this tend to be in X
Possibly the most common cause of X
X is a phenomenon with a variety of causes 
This would allow X
I would rather see X
Turning to possible remedies
A secondary cause is X
The main cause is almost certainly X
There seem to be three main causes, and also two key solutions which we could take to lessen the issue
The question of X is becoming increasingly topical and importand to address
It is indeed true that X
Overall, I feel that opponents of X have the strong argument at present. 
X certainly seems to support this view 
The idea of X has become quite fashionable recently. 
However, there is also substantial opposition to the concept, and we will discuss two views now. 
Those who support X often highlight Y
They feel that X
A second point in favour is that X
Indeed, it seems that such X
Fearing, with some justification, that X
To sum up, it seems true that the problems caused by X do indeed outweigh the possible advantages 
Moreover, they feel that X
X have actually been the result of Y, rather than Z
For example, these opponents state that X
Conversely, however, people who oppose X point to Y, compared to Z
Furthermore, they claim that X
On the one hand, those who urge X, say that Y
There are strong arguments on both sides wether to do X, which we will discuss here
X is a subject which provokes great emotions as well as scientific interest, and at times two become somewhat blurred
On the other hand, X feel this Y has Z which outweighs its possible benefits
There are arguments on both sides, as we will see
Overall, it is true that X. However, Y
For these reasons, I would evaluate X as a tertiary skill, which is important but increasingly less useful than in the past
X is fundamental in modern organisations in both business and the public sector
However, there are two other skills which appear to be more useful, which we evaluate now
In conclusion, it appears that X. Nevertheless, Y
However, this tends to happen when X, rather than Y
Admittedly, it is true that x, for example Y
However, it seems rather excessive to say X, and I will explain why
The possible solutions involve X, and also Y
I find such a tendency rather negative
This seems to have plenty of drawbacks
A further, longer-term solution might be to do X
Regarding possible solutions, probably the most immediate short-term solution would be to do X
This leads us to the second concern, which is X  
There seem to be two main problems stemming from this situation, and also two steps we could take to address it fully
It is inevitable that
To sum up, the causes of X generally relate to Y, while the effects are seen in Z
For instance, X may cause Y, even though Z is A
The issue of X is probably the third factor, and one that impacts on the community as a whole
For example, X may progress to Y
Another effect may be X
Turning to possible effects, X is probably the most serious impact on Y, leading to Z
We can see that X
Another factor may frequently be X, meaning that Y
This can be seen in the way that X
Perhaps, the main cause is X
I can identify two main causes, and three broad effects, which we will describe now
Secondly, it is a fact that X, while Y does not offer this security 
However, if we think of X, Y appears to be a far stronger pathway to progress and independence
In conclusion, I would not wish to underestimate the potential benifits of X, and it should certainly be available as an option 
Of course, those who say that X are quite correct, it is equally true, though, that Y
X cannot genuinely be compared to the benefits of Y
Finally, it is surely wiser to do x
For example, it would be unimaginable to do x
Firstly, it seems simplistic
However, I feel that X, and I will explain the reasons here
However, there are some drawbacks to consider
Furthermore, it is also true that
On the other hand, furthermore, finally
Possible answers might involve
This outweighs their possible disadvantages, as long as they are
Perhaps, the immediate step would be
Added to this is
As we see, for example
On the one hand, it might be said that
To be addressed in one way or another
Might be, can be, may be, tends to be
Those who oppose x
Critics of
Opponents of
Those who support x
Proponents of
Supporters of
Supporters site, refer to, highlight, point to
Supporters claim that, say that
Supporters insist that x is correct
X is a constantly-evolving field of research
X is a much-discussed problem
The ever-present danger of x
X ameliorates Y
X improves Y
X lessens Y
X damages Y
X weakens Y
X undermines Y
X impacts Y
X has an effect on Y
X causes Y
X leads to Y
X results in Y
X brings about Y
X contributes to Y
X affects Y
It is an inescapable fact that
It is undeniable that
It cannot be denied that
The idea should surely be unacceptable
This is surely a further significant factor
There is an almost universal consensus that
It is almost universally accepted that
This concept seems to be somewhat inadequate
The benefits of this approach appear to be overwhelmingly positive 
A second point is
This being the case, it would appear to be
This is because
The other side of this debate is that
X may simply be
It would appear to be
Appears to be
To conclude, it appears that
The long-term consequent problems of X
To counteract these dangers, perhaps the most effective and most immediate solution would be
Another remedy may be to promote X
By which I mean the growth of X 
So this debate is rather complex, as we shall see
This is provided that X
Overall, it appears to me that the stronger argument is in favor of X, with all the advantages of Y 
As a last point, it is also true that X
They also say, with some merit, that X
However, it should be seen as one, among the issues to be solved, and X
Of course, there are also alternatives, including X
On the subject of alternatives
If we now consider other ways to do this
Regarding other possible options
There seem to be a number of drawbacks associated with X, the most significant of which is
It might initially appear desireable to do X, but on closer inspection the idea suffers from several problems
While X may have some advantages, these appear to be outweighed by the costs
It may be true that X is cheaper, nevertheless, in the long term it would be a more expensive option
This means there is a danger that we would be responding to a current threat with an outdated tactic
Secondly, it must be said that X and thus would be rather inefficient
It is probably true that X, but Y
X would appear to be far more robust alternative these days
Overall, we have seen that Y are of limited effectiveness because they are superficial in nature
Both these alternatives would be comparatively cheap, and would address the root of the problem rather than seeking to suppress the symptoms 
Which would have the benefit of Y
Another viable alternative would be
This would generate improved X
Turning to possible alternatives, probably the most effective would be to improve the efficiency of X
The key solution would be X, together with Y
In conclusion, the main problems seem to be X and Y
